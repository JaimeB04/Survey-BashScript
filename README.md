#Survey Bash Project

Created a simple bash survey program to test my ability in bash scripting. This survey has essential
features that include registration, login, storing of account credentials like (username, password)
and creation of personalized cvs files based on each user's response.

##Key Features
- User-friendly that runs on a terminal
- Stores user's respondes in a cvs format
- Supports multiple users partipating on the survey
- Lightweight and works on any linux system
